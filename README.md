## Overview

This GitHub repository presents an investigation into Bitcoin price prediction using an ensemble of linear models and bagging techniques. In today's landscape, numerous studies delve into the composition of Bitcoin prices and propose prediction methods based on Linear Models, utilizing lagged price and volume variables. Here, we introduce a research effort that introduces a rolling window system, generating an ensemble of estimators through Linear Models. These predictions are akin to expert opinions. We explore various techniques, including Linear Model Ensembling, Bagging with Regression Trees, and Neural Networks, to synthesize these opinions into a prediction. The obtained results reveal that, from this perspective, the Bagging technique outperforms the originally proposed models significantly.

## Background

The volatility and complexity of cryptocurrency markets, particularly Bitcoin, have sparked a growing interest in prediction methodologies. Ensembling techniques, like Bagging, provide an avenue for combining multiple models to improve prediction accuracy, stability, and robustness.

## Usage

This repository contains R code showcasing the application of ensemble techniques, specifically Linear Model Ensemble and Bagging, to predict Bitcoin prices. By reviewing the code, you can gain insights into the methodology proposed in this research.
